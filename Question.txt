Create a small application that is able to remove the sky from the videos. Essentially this 
means removing clouds and anything above the horizon which is not in the foreground.

Necessary:
 - use C++
 - use openCV
 - output should be a video stream that can be played back with black or white where the 
sky/clouds used to be
 - the same solution should work on both videos (you can convert to black and white if you 
want though)

Tips/Bonus:
 - finding a line that intersects with the horizon can be useful
 - building the algorithm initially on one frame rather than the entire video is easier
 - bonus points for tracking and filtering across frames
 - feel free to use existing open source algorithms in an attempt to accomplish this but
you have to include links and references to those sources when you present the answer
